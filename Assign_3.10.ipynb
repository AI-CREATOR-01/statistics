    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating the values of population parameters based on sample data. It is used when it is not possible or practical to collect data from an entire population, and instead, a sample of data is collected to make inferences about the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimate refers to a single value that is used to estimate a population parameter. It is calculated based on the sample data and is used as an estimate of the population parameter. For example, if we are interested in estimating the population mean height of all adults in a particular city, we might collect a sample of heights and calculate the sample mean height. The sample mean height is a point estimate of the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimate, on the other hand, refers to a range of values that is used to estimate a population parameter. It is calculated based on the sample data and is used to provide a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. Confidence intervals are an example of interval estimates. Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall, along with a measure of the level of confidence we have in that estimate. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height would provide a range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true population mean height falls."

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether a hypothesis or claim about a population is supported by the data. The following are the general steps involved in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.State the null and alternative hypotheses: Define the null and alternative hypotheses based on the research question and         available information. The null hypothesis is the default assumption that there is no significant difference or relationship     between two or more variables, while the alternative hypothesis is the claim that there is a significant difference or           relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Choose a significance level: Choose a significance level (alpha) to determine the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.   Common choices for alpha are 0.05 or 0.01, which correspond to a 5% or 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is     actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Select a test statistic and distribution: Select a test statistic that measures the difference between the observed data and     the null hypothesis. The choice of test statistic depends on the research question and the type of data being analyzed. The     test statistic follows a specific distribution under the null hypothesis, such as the normal distribution or t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Calculate the test statistic and p-value: Calculate the test statistic and the corresponding p-value, which is the probability   of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the observed value, assuming that the null hypothesis is       true.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Interpret the results: Compare the p-value to the significance level. If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance   level, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than the significance       level, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Draw conclusions: Draw conclusions based on the results of the hypothesis test. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the         alternative hypothesis is supported, and there is evidence of a significant difference or relationship. If the null hypothesis   is not rejected, there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Communicate the results: Communicate the results of the hypothesis test in a clear and concise manner, including the null and   alternative hypotheses, the test statistic and p-value, the conclusion, and any limitations or assumptions made in the           analysis."

It is a bell-shaped distribution that is symmetric around zero, and is similar in shape to the standard normal distribution but with thicker tails. The shape of the t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, which are defined as the sample size minus one.\n",

Specifically, it is used to test hypotheses about the mean of a normally distributed population, when the sample size is too small to rely on the normal distribution. It is also used in cases where the population is not normally distributed, but the sample size is large enough to invoke the Central Limit Theorem."
